# Java-Stock-Data-Parser

This Java project reads data from a text file, extracts relevant information using regular expressions, and then writes the extracted data to a new text file in a structured JSON format. It parses each line of the input file, splits it into fields, and processes the fields to extract product details such as part number, product name, type, plane, price, and quantity. Finally, it outputs the extracted information in JSON format with additional fields like shelf location, stock status, and date of inspection.
